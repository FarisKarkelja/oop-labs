## Description

Welcome to my OOP Java Labs repository! This repository contains Java lab exercises designed to demonstrate and practice key Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Each lab is self-contained and showcases different practical applications of OOP principles.

## Languages and Technologies Used

- Java 
- IntelliJ IDEA 
- Maven

## Features

1. **Classes and Objects:**
   - Learn to define and instantiate classes and objects.
   - Explore constructors, methods, and fields.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - Implement parent and child classes.
   - Understand method overriding and `super` keyword.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Practice dynamic and compile-time polymorphism.
   - Use method overloading and overriding effectively.

4. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement private fields with public getter and setter methods.
   - Learn data hiding principles.

5. **Abstraction:**
   - Work with abstract classes and interfaces.
   - Apply abstraction to create flexible program designs.

6. **Additional OOP Concepts:**
   - Explore nested classes, static members, and packages.
   - Practice exception handling and file I/O within OOP contexts.

## Installation

No installation is required to run these labs. Simply clone the repository and open the project folder in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended). Compile and run the Java files as needed.
